# odin-recipes
This is a simple recipe website project that im doing as part of the odin project foundations course.
I hope to use all of the skills I've learned so far aswell as learn some more as the project goes on.
I was thinking of just doing the changes to sam's website but I decided to make a separate website so I fully learn all the course has to teach and test it out first so I can then add the stuff I like to the other one.

I will add a self-reflection here when I finish.

Self-reflection:
Honestly I felt pretty good doing this mini project, it was pretty simple and I gained quite a bit of confidence, the last recipe I added (carbonara) was super fast and felt like I didn't struggle at all.
VS Code makes it SUUUUUUUPEER easy to commit and push honestly but I kinda want to do it from the console a bit more to fully learn that and maybe explore all the git commands.
Html is super easy so far lol, we'll see how I do with css.
